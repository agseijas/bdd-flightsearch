This is a Java project which uses BDD to create a conceptual flight search.

The only tools used are testing frameworks:

- Concordion for BDD instrumentation (as alternative to Cucumber, Calabash, JBehave, DaSpec...).
- JUnit & Hamcrest

Concordion will generate an HTML report with the evidence of the compliance to the business rules and full compliance.
